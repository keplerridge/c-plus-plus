# Overview

This project was one that I made to get to know C++ a little bit better. It was something that I thought would be a good initial stretch for me.

This software is just three different sorting algorithms that sort through vectors of integers.

I wrote this because I know that C++ is siginificantly more different than the languages I am used to. It isn't what I would call super user friendly.

# Development Environment

I used the GCC compiled and VSCode as my IDE to write this.

I wrote this in C++. I do not completely understand every aspect at this point but I think that iostream and vector are both technically libraries in C++ that I used.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- I am not sure how to go about making comparable objects in C++ but I would like to do that.
- I think that it is also normal for C++ to have several different files or modules holding functionality or object code that get imported, for lack of a better term, into one. I would like to set up that structure a little more.
